# LeetCode

Repository for my daily challenges on LeetCode. After I came back to study Data Structures and Algorithms, I felt a little rusty on some of programming logic, 
so I started to do some LeetCode questions for fun. I also was doing some experimentation with some of the Collections of C-Sharp, demonstrating the uses of some 
of them to a friend, so I added as an embedded console application on the solution.
