# LeetCode 

Repository for my weekly challenges on LeetCode. After I came back to study Data Structures and Algorithms, I felt a little rusty on some of programming logic, so I started to do some LeetCode questions for fun. 
I also was doing some experimentation with some of the Collections of C-Sharp, and demonstrating the uses of some of them to a friend, so I added as an embedded console application on the solution.

## LeetCode/
Directory where I will keep doing challenges, starting from Easy, to Medium and then finally to Hard ones.

> Try it yourself, at the [leetcode](https://leetcode.com/problemset/all/) website. Is quite fun!


**Each class** in this directory represents receives the **name of the challenge, and has my solution**. 

> :warning: My solutions are not always the not the most optimal ones. 

Sometimes I can't come up with the most optimal solution on my own, or am I just amazed with other solutions created by other programmers. So, there it's possible that some classes contains multiple solutions.   

## Collections/
Where I was showing the uses of the collections to a friend, and did some experimentation. **Only proof of work purposes**.

It contains two directories, one for the main data structures, and one for sorted collections when I give just an example and try to present the difference between an SortedList and a SortedDictionary

It also contains the dir `content/`, which I used images to explain the concept behind some of the structures.

I plan on explaining about the multi-dimension arrays, and the jagged arrays.
